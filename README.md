<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a simple work day scheduler that can be used to organize one's activities for the day.

### User Story:

    AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

This is what you can expect to see upon opening the page:

> The hourly blocks that are the past will display grey, the present time block will display red and the future time blocks will display green.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This webpage was built with Bootstrap which makes it extremely responsive to any browser size:

<img src="./assets/picture-2.png"  width="400rem" display='inline'>
<img src="./assets/picture-6.png"  width="411rem" display='inline'>


All of your saved daily actions will actually save on this webpage so you can revisit and edit whenever you want!
